a. What is an issue?
An "issue" refers to a task, problem, or suggestion that needs to be tracked and addressed, particularly in software development and project management contexts. In software development, issues can include bug reports, feature requests, enhancement suggestions, or any other matter that requires attention. Typically, teams use issue tracking systems to record, assign, and track these issues to ensure they are addressed and resolved in a timely manner. Issues help teams coordinate work, troubleshoot problems, and tracke the progress of projects.

b. What is a pull request?
A "pull request" is a feature commonly used in version control systems like Git, particularly in collaborative development workflows by platforms like GitHub or Gitlab.

To open a pull request, we tipically follow these steps using Git like GitHUB
1. Fork the Repository
2. Clone the Forked Repository
3. Create Branch
4. Make Changes

f. What does git diff do?
The git diff command is sued to display the differences between two states of a Git repository. Here's what it does:
1. Show changes between working directory and staging area
2. Show changes between staging area and repository
3. show changes between commits

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch in a git repository is typically the default and primary branch that contains the latest stable version of the project. it's often named "main", 'master' or 'develop', depending on the naming conventions followed by the project or organization. 

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
Pushing changing directly to the main branch, especially in a collaborative environment or for projects with multiple contributors, is generallly not recommended. Here are some reasons: Risk of breaking the main codebase; lake of code review; difficulty in collaboration; difficulty in managing releases.
